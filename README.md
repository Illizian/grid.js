# A Responsive Drag & Drop Widget Dashboard

## Why?

I've used [gridster.js](http://gridster.net/) for awhile but have often been hampered by it's lack of responsive'ness'. My latest project required a responsive dashboard and tweaking gridster was taking longer than I felt it would take to build my own minimal version - so here it is.
